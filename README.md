# Reverse-Engineered Trading Indicators

A collection of reverse engineered trading indicators for TradingView. Open source, transparent, and built for traders.

## Introduction

This repository contains various trading indicators that have been reverse-engineered from popular premium indicators. All indicators are written in Pine Script (v6) for TradingView and are fully open source.

My goal is to provide free access to powerful tools that are often sold behind paywalls. Each indicator is optimized for clarity, reliability, and customization.

## List of Indicators

- Overbought/Oversold_channel (Overbought Oversold Channel/README.md)

## Installation

1. Open TradingView → Go to the Pine Script Editor.
2. Copy the code from the indicator’s **.pine** file.
3. Paste it into the Pine Script Editor and click **Add to Chart**.
4. Save the script and name it as you like.
