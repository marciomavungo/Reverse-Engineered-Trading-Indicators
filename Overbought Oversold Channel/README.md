## Description
This is the open-source and free version of the popular premium indicator "drybeans channel".
I added the features to change the length of each MA, the source for each MA and the type of MA calculation for better customization.
This indicator tells the trader when is an asset overbought or oversold based on varios moving averages calculations of the high, open and the low.

## How to use
When the purple line touch the red line, price is overbought, **sell**.
When the purple line touches the green line, price is oversold, **buy**.
